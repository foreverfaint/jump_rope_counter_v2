# JumpRopeCounterV2

This project is a Flutter project, which leverages TFLite to count how many jumps your kid makes by camera. Please note this is purely a practice with some interesting technologies, e.g. Tensorflow and Flutter. 

However if you really need to count jumps for your kid, I recommend you to buy [this](https://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?fsb=y&IndexArea=product_en&CatId=&SearchText=jump+rope+count).

## Thanks
